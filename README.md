# What we aim to solve

The Problem statement is to come with a innovative approach to identify any analyse trends that are out through various sources across India. This can be trends related to the film industry, seasonal time frames, events, sports etc.


After proper Identification of such trends, finding innovative ways of suitably incorporating the trends into relevant  fashion related flows like Designing and Merchandising is to be devised.

## Approach
1. Trend identification for content:
Social media and search engine sources like Instagram, Twitter and Google are the most common platforms for new entities to start trending. This part of the idea aims to use the developer APIs of all such different internet entities to start mining for the most talked about or 'hottest' topics being talked amongst the people which are indicate an uprising tends. With the identification and a Sentiment Analysis of the identified topic at hand, the last step would be coming up with insightful taglines or general content about the trendy topic. lastly finding a list of key social media influencers for better marketing is also to be implemented

2. Develop a computer vision model that can identify and classify different articles of clothing as well as most design aspects like clothing patterns, designs, materials, colour combinations etc. 

3. Running a model like this on pictures posted on social media by film celebrities, YouTubers, sports people etc would help identify the most trendy styles of clothing. A dashboard would help conveying the most popular colour combinations, patterns etc. Thus helping designers come up with ideas themselves.

## Contributing to existing industry standards
Contribution to existing industry standard:

Keeping up with the trends followed by the country is a must to keep business flowing.

Our solution would firstly, help identifying those topics quickly. For example, the IPL in India holds a very positive sentiment across the nation.

More specifically, identifying a particular team's/player's positive sentiment and coming with a interesting tagline/design for them would surely be a quick seller and would cut down on huge time and human capital.

Secondly, identifying the trends in clothing of internet celebrities and providing insightful statistics would help modern day designers come up with more designs and a wider range of products ultimately boost sales for the company.

For example, if a picture of Hrithik Roshan wearing a unique style of clothing got famous amongst others then a proper identification of details would help designers come up with more ideas/designs like that.
